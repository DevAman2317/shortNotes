vii) High-level Language:

i) 	ECMAScript Standards: 
	JavaScript is based on ECMAScript standards. 
	ECMAScript is the standardized specification of the scripting language, 
	and new versions bring in new features and improvements.

ii) Dynamic Typing: 
    JavaScript is dynamically typed, 
	allowing variables to hold values of any data type without 
	explicit type declarations. 
	This flexibility makes it easier to write and maintain code	

ii) Cross-platform Compatibility: 
	JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, 
	making it a cross-platform language for web development. 
	Additionally, JavaScript can also be used on the server-side 
	(e.g., with Node.js), enabling full-stack development with a single language.

ii) Rich Ecosystem and Libraries: 
	JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) 

ii) Event-Driven: 
	Events 	allowing developers to create interactive and responsive web applications.
	
ii) Client-Side Scripting: 
	JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers, 
	allowing developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) 
	to dynamically update the content, structure, and style of web pages
	in response to user interactions.

ii) Asynchronous Programming with Promises and Async/Await: 

iii) Template Literals: 
     Template literals allow for easier string interpolation 
	 and multi-line strings by using backticks (`).
	 
iv) Spread and Rest Operators: 
    The spread (...) and rest (...) operators provide a convenient way 
	to work with arrays and objects. 	 

v)  Destructuring Assignment:work with arrays

vi) Classes and Object-Oriented Programming: 
    JavaScript supports object-oriented programming (OOP) 
	with the introduction of classes and inheritance. 
	Although JavaScript's class system is prototype-based,
	like OOP languages like Java or C++.

 

viii) Dynamic Typing: 
      JavaScript is dynamically typed, allowing variables to hold values of any data type without explicit type declarations. This flexibility makes it easier to write and maintain code
